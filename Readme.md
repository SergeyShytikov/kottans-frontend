## Git Basics <span id="task0"></span>

- before this course, git for me was like magic, I could not distinguish github, gitlab and git itself
- I was very surprised that you can flexibly configure the terminal and work with git through aliases
- I knew that Torvalds was a genius, but so

### Version Control with Git - Udacity course

- an excellent course to take the first steps in learning git

### learngitbranching.js.org

- branch visualization is very cool, it helps to understand a lot
- was surprised that git pull is magic from fetch and merge

### Communicating using Markdown

- md it's so usefull format for education and notes new knowledges

### Typing Club

- this is really good, I try to practice a couple of new exercises every day.
